Primarily targetted at the students of UG-1 at IIIT-H. We'll cover the fundamentals of the language such as variables, conditional logic, loops and functions. We'll also look at Python's vast variety of built in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. The learn-by-doing approach of this seminar will help solidify the foundations of Python in your mind."],

Then in a 40 day period, implement the technologies related to it. Team up with as many friends as you want, there are no restrictions at all! (But keep in mind that you want to have a decent share of prize money per person.)",

It’s okay if you haven’t got the technical skills to implement your ideas yet, that’s what this platform is for! With the help of our amazing mentors to guide you with the technical aspects, you’ll gain new skills and be able to get your hands dirty with them over the course of under two months."
